## Objectives:

- Modify the CF template to meet updated requirements
- Run a website using `nginx` or `apache2` on hosts in the pool
- Configure `haproxy` as a load balancer to direct traffic to the pool

## Project Description

In your repository, create a `Project3` folder.

For this project, you will have two deliverables:

1. CloudFormation template with modifications for project
2. Documentation (and specified screenshots) for configuring the ADC and hosts post stack creation. 

### Provided Resources

The following is provided in this project folder:

- [`lb-cf-template.yml`](lb-cf-template.yml)
  - Note: this templated is updated from previous versions to get you started on this project
- [`site.tar.gz`](site.tar.gz)
  - A base that includes `css` in order to make something look nice quickly.  `index.html`, at minimum, should be something you spice up to make unique.
      - you may use your own site (perhaps from previous courses)
      - grading the content of the site is not a part of the rubric.

## Part 1 - CloudFormation Template TODOs

The CloudFormation template provided in this project folder is **updated from Project 2** to get you started on this project.

Your deliverable for this portion is only **your CloudFormation template**.

Modify the template in the following ways:

1. Use AMI of your choice (from P1/P2 for example)
2. VPC CIDR block: `172.18.0.0/23`
3. Public subnet range: `172.18.0.0 - 172.18.0.255`
4. Private subnet range: `172.18.1.0 - 172.18.1.255`
5. Modifications for Security Group:
   - Allow `ssh` requests within VPC CIDR block
   - Allow `ssh` requests from your home IP
   - Allow `http` requests from within VPC CIDR block
   - Allow `http` requests from any IP
   - *If doing Extra Credit* Add `https` rules in addition to `http` rules
6. For the load balancer (proxy) instance:
   - assign private IP on public subnet
   - install `haproxy`
   - configure a unique `hostname` on the instance
7. For host instances:
   - create three total host instances (one is templated, two more need to be added)
   - tag each with a unique name
   - assign each private IP on private subnet
   - install `apache2` or `nginx` on each
   - configure a unique `hostname` on each instance

**The deliverable for this part is the CloudFormation template in your Project 3 folder.**

## Part 2 - Setup Load Balancing TODOs

In your `Project3` folder, create a `README.md` file.  This document will focus on finishing configuration after your stack builds.

1. Project description
   - Provide an overview of the project goal
   - Provide a description of how to use the CF template to create a stack and what resources are created.
   - Create a **diagram** of how the load balancer works in context of your resources
      - See [Project 2 for diagram resources](../Project2/README.md)
2. `ssh` within VPC:
   - Configure `/etc/hosts` OR `.ssh/config` on each instance
      - I like to do both, but that's me
   - Describe how the file is configured on each instance and what the benefit is
   - Document how to `ssh` among the instances
3. How to set up a HAProxy load balancer:
   - What file(s) where modified & their location
   - What configuration(s) were set (if any)
   - How to restart the service after a configuration change
   - Resources used (websites)
4. How to set up Hosts 1, 2, & 3 to serve web content
   - **NOTE** web content should be uniquely yours, but as stated you may use `site.tar.gz` as a base and make modifications to the text
   - Document any changed configuration files (if any)
   - Document where site content files are located (and why)
   - How to restart the service in case of a configuration change
   - Resources used (websites)
5. Prove in two ways that your load balancer is working:
   - Have your backend hosts serve web content, but with a small but noticeable variation.  Take a set of screenshots that show the URL bar and varying content from different hosts.
   - Take a screenshot of your `haproxy` logs that prove your requests are being distributed to different backend hosts.
      - Include in your documentation the command you used to view the correct logs

## Resources and Warnings

- You **DO NOT** need to mess with UFW rules. You may lock yourself out of SSH access.
- You can have a maximum of **FIVE Elastic IP Addresses and FIVE VPCs**

## Extra Credit - HTTPS

Enable HTTPS (SSL encryption) for your load balancer.  I am going to leave some choice here of whether you have only your load balancer decrypt / encrypt packets for the hosts or have the hosts handle the decryption / encryption.

You will owe a very good write up on all elements involved to set up HTTPS.  A start, which mentions some additional things you'll need, is [HAProxy SSL Termination](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-ssl-termination)

### Resources
These are a collection of sites I used to set up HTTPS and get the correct SSL certificate (remember haproxy wants a "combo" file of the private and public cert)

## Submission

1. Your repo should contain:
